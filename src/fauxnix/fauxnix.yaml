#While writing this I believe I found a bug in pacman. If you  
#try to install from a text file containing invalid packages, such as
#those from the AUR, pacman will not only give an error for each of them,
#the expected behavior, but also forget to install any valid package.
#Paru works fine and continues installing even it finds and invalid 
#package, so if you have anything installed from outside official
#repos, make sure to use paru or another AUR helper
